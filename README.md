#  TextCapturePro – OCR Based Text Recognition App

TextCapturePro is an Android application that extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It enables users to capture, edit, save, and share text easily from images such as documents, notes, and posters.

---

##  Project Overview

TextCapturePro is designed to simplify text extraction using modern OCR technology. It uses **Google ML Kit** to recognize text efficiently and accurately from images captured via camera or selected from the gallery.

##  Features

-  Capture text using device camera  
-  Extract text from gallery images  
-  Crop and preprocess images before scanning  
-  Edit recognized text  
-  Save extracted text locally  
-  Share text easily  
-  View previously scanned text
